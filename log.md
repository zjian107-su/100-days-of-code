# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## I want to advance my Python programming and program documentation skills.
## More personal development content recorded on Intagram: danielzezheng.dev

### Day 1: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Search more resources to advance my skills in JavaScript and VueJs
- Tested template syntax on codepen

**Thoughts:** Working with Vue CLI was convinient, but it took me a while to run files with 'NPM and Vue'. Vue is easy to work with, at least for now.

### Day 2: January 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Vue directives
- 3 LeetCode practices

**Thoughts:** Feel like I need some review on JavaScript props



### Day 3: January 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practices: dynamic programming, DFS, BFS
- #100DaysOfCode forked repo setup
- Coding goal posted on personal Ins account

**Thoughts:** It is a great start of the project. I look forward to completing this project, and maybe making a good coding friend.

### Day 4: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

- Luck will make things work. Taking risks to apply and face the fear of rejection because we can still appreciate what we learned during the process
- Searched phycology terms
- Did almost 2 hours of LeetCode practice
- OA coding for 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Dynamic programming is such a work of art! 

### Day 5: January 11, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Virtual interview with HW - 1 hour 
- OA from BR - 3 hours
  

**Thoughts:** Showing your ability to develop an efficient algorithm is much more important and difficult rather than dealing with user input ðŸ¥¸. I don't enjoy ACM mode much, I prefer core function mode. 

### Day 6: January 12, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 8 LeetCode Practices

**Thoughts** Being unhappy with what you donâ€™t yet know is a sign that youâ€™re a good developer.

### Day 7: January 13, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished 3 LeetCode practices
- Earned 2 badges - Algo 01 and DS 01 in Python 
- Completed 1 OA from DB - 1 hour
  

**Thoughts:** DP, DFS, BFS, Matrix are difficult problems to solve. Whenever I find those in OA, I panic a little ðŸ˜†, and sometimes I have to give up on them. Today marks my day 20 streak! Hooray!

### Day 8: January 14, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
  
**Thoughts:** headq.heapify(aList) =  O(n)

### Day 9: January 15, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 hours OA from BD
  

**Thoughts:** 
Sum: the OA was fairly easy but handling user input in different formats need some practices. 

1. **Top-Down**: memoization is a great way for computationally expensive programs, **recursion**; **Botton-up**: an effective way of avoiding recursion by decreasing the time complexity that recursion builds up, recursion with memoization
2. Good quotes from @[cool_shark](https://leetcode.com/cool_shark) from [LeetCode.com](http://LeetCode.com)

> Training with LeetCode is like training for a marathon. For an onsite interview or programming competition, one needs to endure minimum 90 minutes to 6 hours of pain, that demand great deal of mental stamina and experience both of which require time to accumulate. With the exception of those naturally talented people who can run a full marathon without any preparation, normal people usually need to dedicate 6 months to 2 years of consistent training to be ready for a race. The preparation usually starts with a mild jogging, then gradually increase distance and speed so that one can run faster and longer. Beginners who never ran marathon have massive anxiety and are completely overwhelmed. But with planning and consistent training, anybody can run marathon including disabled people and 80 years old people.

### Day 10: January 17, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
- Read about functional programming - Elixir
  

**Thoughts:** I skipped one day because I was too tired from driving. And it is not a productive day today. But, letâ€™s keep it going. Ahhhhh, matrix!

### Day 11: January 18, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practices
  

**Thoughts:** I get better in matrix! Hooray! 


### Day 12: January 20, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 5 LeetCode practices
- Attempted 1 LeetCode practice (TBC)
  

**Thoughts:** I caught up on some work from the break I took yesterday. I enjoyed my interview with TM yesterday. I look forward to finishing 7 problems tomorrow to earn my Dynamic Programming I badge! I have earned Algo 01 and DS 01 in Python. Let's go!

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
