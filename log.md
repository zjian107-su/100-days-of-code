# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## I want to advance my Python programming and program documentation skills.

### Day 1: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Search more resources to advance my skills in JavaScript and VueJs
- Tested template syntax on codepen

**Thoughts:** Working with Vue CLI was convinient, but it took me a while to run files with 'NPM and Vue'. Vue is easy to work with, at least for now.

### Day 2: January 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Vue directives
- 3 LeetCode practices

**Thoughts:** Feel like I need some review on JavaScript props



### Day 3: January 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practices: dynamic programming, DFS, BFS
- #100DaysOfCode forked repo setup
- Coding goal posted on personal Ins account

**Thoughts:** It is a great start of the project. I look forward to completing this project, and maybe making a good coding friend.

### Day 4: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

- Luck will make things work. Taking risks to apply and face the fear of rejection because we can still appreciate what we learned during the process
- Searched phycology terms
- Did almost 2 hours of LeetCode practice
- OA coding for 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Dynamic programming is such a work of art! 

### Day 5: January 11, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Virtual interview with HW - 1 hour 
- OA from BR - 3 hours
  

**Thoughts:** Showing your ability to develop an efficient algorithm is much more important and difficult rather than dealing with user input ðŸ¥¸. I don't enjoy ACM mode much, I prefer core function mode.

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
