# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## I want to advance my Python programming and program documentation skills.
## More personal development content recorded on Intagram: danielzezheng.dev

### Day 1: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Search more resources to advance my skills in JavaScript and VueJs
- Tested template syntax on codepen

**Thoughts:** Working with Vue CLI was convinient, but it took me a while to run files with 'NPM and Vue'. Vue is easy to work with, at least for now.

### Day 2: January 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Vue directives
- 3 LeetCode practices

**Thoughts:** Feel like I need some review on JavaScript props



### Day 3: January 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practices: dynamic programming, DFS, BFS
- #100DaysOfCode forked repo setup
- Coding goal posted on personal Ins account

**Thoughts:** It is a great start of the project. I look forward to completing this project, and maybe making a good coding friend.

### Day 4: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

- Luck will make things work. Taking risks to apply and face the fear of rejection because we can still appreciate what we learned during the process
- Searched phycology terms
- Did almost 2 hours of LeetCode practice
- OA coding for 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Dynamic programming is such a work of art! 

### Day 5: January 11, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Virtual interview with HW - 1 hour 
- OA from BR - 3 hours
  

**Thoughts:** Showing your ability to develop an efficient algorithm is much more important and difficult rather than dealing with user input 🥸. I don't enjoy ACM mode much, I prefer core function mode. 

### Day 6: January 12, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 8 LeetCode Practices

**Thoughts** Being unhappy with what you don’t yet know is a sign that you’re a good developer.

### Day 7: January 13, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished 3 LeetCode practices
- Earned 2 badges - Algo 01 and DS 01 in Python 
- Completed 1 OA from DB - 1 hour
  

**Thoughts:** DP, DFS, BFS, Matrix are difficult problems to solve. Whenever I find those in OA, I panic a little 😆, and sometimes I have to give up on them. Today marks my day 20 streak! Hooray!

### Day 8: January 14, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
  
**Thoughts:** headq.heapify(aList) =  O(n)

### Day 9: January 15, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 hours OA from BD
  

**Thoughts:** 
Sum: the OA was fairly easy but handling user input in different formats need some practices. 

1. **Top-Down**: memoization is a great way for computationally expensive programs, **recursion**; **Botton-up**: an effective way of avoiding recursion by decreasing the time complexity that recursion builds up, recursion with memoization
2. Good quotes from @[cool_shark](https://leetcode.com/cool_shark) from [LeetCode.com](http://LeetCode.com)

> Training with LeetCode is like training for a marathon. For an onsite interview or programming competition, one needs to endure minimum 90 minutes to 6 hours of pain, that demand great deal of mental stamina and experience both of which require time to accumulate. With the exception of those naturally talented people who can run a full marathon without any preparation, normal people usually need to dedicate 6 months to 2 years of consistent training to be ready for a race. The preparation usually starts with a mild jogging, then gradually increase distance and speed so that one can run faster and longer. Beginners who never ran marathon have massive anxiety and are completely overwhelmed. But with planning and consistent training, anybody can run marathon including disabled people and 80 years old people.

### Day 10: January 17, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
- Read about functional programming - Elixir

### Day 13: January 21, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 7 LeetCode practices
  

**Thoughts:** I finished 7 problems and earned my Dynamic Programming I badge! 

### Day 14: January 22, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Learned JS: callbacks, promises, async/await
- Reviewed LeetCode pratices


**Thoughts:** It's a productive day. I would like to know where my time goes in more detail, so I started another time tracker here. Raw data is recorded in MD format. data is calculated within Excel.

### Day 15: January 23, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Got more solid understanding of callbacks, promises and async/await usages.
- Skimmed some VueJS vids

**Thoughts:** 
- [This freecodecamp video is golden for async topic!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYb_ZU8LNxs)
- [VueJS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs)

**Thoughts:** 020222!!!! So many `2` in this date! After coding for so long, I am more sensitive to numbers and digits now🥸.

### Day 22: Febuary 03, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 LeetCode practice
- Read Elixir doc


**Thoughts:** Often you realize you did totally wrong after spending hours and hours attempting to solve a problem. You fail so many times, then you elevate your pain tolerance.

> ✨**You are good because you were bad. The worse you were, the more potential of growth you can get.**  ✨
> 

Dang salty chicken soup - good soup  💁‍♂️💁‍♂️💁‍♂️💁‍♂️ 
### Day 23: Febuary 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 LeetCode practice

**Thoughts:** The merge K sorted lists problem needs the function of merge 2 sorted lists, and “devide and conquer”.
### Day 24: Febuary 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practice (plus 1 review)

**Thoughts:** I got a phone call at 4:00 am from my friend. I started to mumble in different languages, and then I also mentioned Elixir. It means I am getting it🤪. 

### Day 25: Febuary 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
- 3 hours of Swift

**Thoughts:** 
It was a productive day. I worked and studied from 9:30 am to 0:30 am. It looked like 15 hours, but I spent 2 hours for my dinner. So it was 12 hours;) 

I am not very tired with my current workload becasue I am content ☺️.
### Day 26: Febuary 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 3 hours of Swift

**Thoughts:** 
8 + 8 = 16 hr. 👍

### Day 27: Febuary 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1.5 hours of interview practice

**Thoughts:** 
My LeetCode skills get a little cold after resting for 10 days.

Big day!🤪 I got another summer intern offer

### Day 28: Febuary 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift

**Thoughts:** 
struct vs class


### Day 29: March 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift for 2 hours

### Day 30: March 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift for 3 hours

**Thoughts:** 
MVVM, mutation, observer, struct and class
### Day 31: March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Elixir full review:  var, atom, condition, list, tuple, dict, aync (parallel), recursion, func, module. 

**Thoughts:** 
After drinking a few hours of elixir,  I am technically stronger. 
### Day 32: March 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
ctrl-B Move the cursor left
ctrl-F Move the cursor right d
ctrl-P View the previous command (or move the cursor up)
ctrl-N View the next command (or move the cursor down)
ctrl-A Move the cursor to the beginning of the line**

**ctrl-E Move the cursor to the end of the line
ctrl-W Erase the preceding word
ctrl-U Erase from cursor to beginning of line
ctrl-K Erase from cursor to end of line**

ctrl-Y Paste erased text (for example, from ctrl-U)

**Thoughts:** 
Linux is cool, but I found it hard to practice those commands in good use. For example, some of the materials, like symbolic links, I have learned those in my operating system class. I don’t find it practical in working place, yet. 
### Day 33: March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
More than 5 hours of Phoenix (Elixir)

- check version: `mix phoenix.new --version`
- pgadmin, postgresql
- phoenix new pages, controller, view, template, routers

**Thoughts:** 
I am stuck on the version problem because the current Phoenix(v1.6) set LiveView as the default and I am following a tutorial that used Phoenix(v1.5.5). I am working on the walkarounds, either learning the new version and implementing it in a new way by reading all the docs, or trying to roll back to 1.5.5 of Phoenix and the right version of Elixir. The tool configuration is daunting and I hope I can find better solutions.
### Day 34: March 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Codes


**Thoughts:** 
None

### Day 35: March 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Generated fake data with Python Faker and csv file for db use
- Operated Local PostgreSQL server with pgAdmin: create db, create dt, primary key, data type, constraint
- Ran Python grpc instance


**Thoughts:** 
Now I can say that I have some experience in PostgreSQL. Hooray!

### Day 36: March 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
#imageLiteral( can be used as image literal caller.


**Thoughts:** 
Coding monkey I am let’s go

### Day 37: April 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Alignment constraint and pining constraint in iOS
- AWS QuickSight data modeling


**Thoughts:** 
It was nice to catch up with friends about their jobs and work life balances. Great day!
### Day 38: April 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Linux reading


**Thoughts:** 
✨ I learned some stuff about viking, therapy dog and Linux commands!

### Day 39: April 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Reading book “Data And Reality” by William Kent


**Thoughts:** 
Someone lend this book and comment this book as “50% of data and 50% of philosophy”. I like the way how the author starts this book by asking questions and throwing a bunch of examples to help people understand the questions. Learning by examples and clarifying with examples are the best way to go.

Due to human language ambiguity, whoever got the power to define would have the greatest power, such as lawmakers and great innovators.
Asking the accurate question is the most important for software engineers.
### Day 40: April 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- gRPC quick start and YouTube tutorials
- Data modeling and data visualization


**Thoughts:** 
I just read that gPRC is actually a Google project. That is new. I am looking into that for my NLP class final project.  
I also learned that the true size of map. For example, do you know Greenland is actually smaller than India? But on the map it is much bigger🥸?
### Day 41: May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1.5 hours of reading
- Some Guitar playing, and made 3 more new friends.


**Thoughts:** 
So I am reading the book A Programmer's Rantings by Steve Yegge. I finished around 80 pages and it talked about software architecture, language  features and how to program in general. This book is very interesting. I look forward to finishing it.

### Day 42: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Book reading



**Thoughts:** 
Continuing reading the book a programmer's rantings by Yegger, it concludes that weak type language brings the delusive sense of security, while strong type language finish the work much faster and cleaner. That’s was interesting.

### Day 43: May 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- LeetSomeCode


**Thoughts:** 
LeetCode Practice tips
### Day 44: May 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1.5 hrs in LeetCode


**Thoughts:** 
I walked in the mall for a few hours, then I hiked for 4 hours to see a water fall. I made it to the 1.5 hrs coding practices tonight. Yay👍. Let’s get the new addition in. 
### Day 45: May 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 hrs in LeetCode


**Thoughts:** 
Good job on the day 2 of interview practice! Coding after 8 hours of working is definitely exhausting. My skill gets rusted. But over the summer, I should be back on track. Job season is up again! More updates are coming.
### Day 46: Jun 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 30 minutes of LeetCoding

**Thoughts:** 
It’s slow today, so I went to skate to refresh my mind and enjoy exploring the city. 

### Day 49: Jun 07, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded nearly 1 hour. 5 questions
- Finished resume revision

**Thoughts:** 
If you write notes, including main data structures and some of the algorithm hints, that could help you review your LeetCode problems efficiently. For example, I write this note - “corner case first - if it's empty, then return empty list, or recursion and print the vale as a list in the middle.”. You can tell it’s No.94. 
### Day 50: Jun 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded nearly 1 hour. 6 questions
- Hit the gym: 50 pushups, 50 sit-ups, 2 minutes of roping

**Thoughts:** 
Work out and practice coding are similar. You don’t lift 130 pounds often in real life, but you practice it in the gym. You probably deal with APIs and data transformation more than design algorithms in programming, but we spend a lot of time on it anyway. I don’t think some senior SDEs can even do code practices but they are good at what they do!

`Coding practice (future career growth) - Personal side project (social impact) - Work knowledge growth (current job performance)`**. Those three things are like sleep - study - social triangle in college. Well, at least I ate a good meal today.** 
### Day 51: Jun 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded for 0.5 hour

**Thoughts:** 
I went to meet a few new friends from the local instead of staying in and finish my 18 practice questions. I think it is worthy because I met a lop rabbit and I cut all his nails for my friend. 
### Day 52: Jun 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded for 3.5 hours, 3 medium problems.

**Thoughts:** 
I found nighttime passes faster than usual. According to my table, I try to get as many practices as possible in my schedule, but the more you do in one day, the more review you have to do later. For example, I am supposed to finish reviewing/coding for 12 previous questions, a medium would take me 20 minutes minimum, and an easy would take me 10 minutes to review. It would take me around 3 hours just to review.

I shouldn’t pack too much in one go😆. Or push until burnout per say😅.

### Day 53: Jun 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded for 1 hour, 9 coding puzzle reviews

**Thoughts:** 
Let’s get it!
### Day 54: Jun 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Coded for 2.5 hours, 6 coding puzzles

**Thoughts:** 
Bit operations are so funky! 
### Day 55: Jun 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Microsoft Azure Data Scientist 30 day challenge module 02 ongoing

**Thoughts:** 
Wow, so many 2 in today’s date!! It’s amazing😆. I will set an alarm for 122222 for sure I am looking forward to applying Azure AutoML in some of my work for prediction. Mainly they are Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector machine, Naive Bayes. I am 5 hours behind on this. I will go easier on my LeetCode and job apps for now. New priority for Ml modeling, validation and testing.
### Day 56: Jun 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Completed 3 modules in Microsoft Azure 30 Days Challenge - Data Scientist
- Completed 90 minutes OA interview coding
- Read 30 minutes of Linux book - file system, device system, GRUB, system init, kernel boots and SWAP


**Thoughts:**
LeetCode is awesome for virtual/onsite, but what is good for OA? OA focuses so much on data manipulations like dates and strings and so on, and LeetCode doesn’t deal with dates.

### Day 57: July 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 hr coding practice


**Thoughts:**
This flu is killing me ;(
### Day 58: July 06, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1.5 hr coding practice
- 2.5 hours of online assessment


**Thoughts:**
I was reading BSS forums about how summer interns at Meta heard some negative news about their delays of return offer. That’s very unfortunate. 

Now we have 5,000 more people doing coding practice just like me.
### Day 59: July 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 hr coding practice (6 quick reviews)
- 1 hours of reading and 2 job apps


**Thoughts:**
I had a super big bow of Yunnan Cross Bridge Noddle with extra noodles. I was about to faint because of how good the food was. I was satisfied.  
### Day 60: July 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 hrs job applications


**Thoughts:**
What a productive day! I ran for 40 minutes with Nabi, and I watched some Netflix version of Planet Earth. Animals are so cool. I learned there is a breed of snails from Peru. Each single snail has different pattern and color - it's so different that the predators are also confused if it will be the same good meal as he had yesterday.😅
### Day 61: July 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 0.5 hr coding practice
- 0.5 hr job app


**Thoughts:**
I was too sleepy since 9PM and I couldn’t concentrate well. Maybe my leg muscle needs a recover from the run yesterday. 
### Day 62: July 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 hr coding practice


**Thoughts:**
**The happiest day of my summer in intern days(July 14, 2022)**

1. Met a twin who looks identical, and sounds the same also.
2. Met someone who is very interested in my culture and my life experience
3. Cracked a lot of good jokes in good times, and felt like a good comedian
4. I appreciate the people who were sitting with me at the lunch today, who made my day
5. I sucked at ping pong for so long in the internship, now I finally start to get the strategy. Learned aggressive play style from Nathan.
6. Played one table pool, and one smooth back pocket!
7. The weather is pretty nice
8. I walked Nabi for like 2 hours and he is a good boy, except he was snappy towards another dog
9. Two Vanilla Froyo, and I got literally a half bowl of Froyo in the second one. I was like thank you so much. And she was like yeah we usually gave half bowl. I swear it was a full bowl. I wear glasses but I am not blind.
10. I passed Amazon online assessment! I will do a 6-hour interview next week

### Day 63: July 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
-  1.5 hrs coding practice
-  1 hr job interview prep


**Thoughts:**

I didn’t study CS in my undergrad, and I have never done Leetcode. I didn’t see myself in big tech at first, but more of a fintech consultant guy. Stupid imposter syndrome in the past. Today when I went to order chick-fil-a for my dinner, I saw all the tall buildings around me with big names.  I took a picture of the building just to remind all is possible. I appreciate Ro’s encouragement since last year. One year I changed a shit ton and I am pretty happy. 

I will call it a day.
### Day 64: July 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
-  1.5 hrs coding practice



**Thoughts:**
Just a late update from 071722

**Today's Progress**: 
-  2 hrs of PPT

**Thoughts:**
My Saturday was great. I skated for a whole afternoon and I went to eat in a pretty authentic Chinese restaurant. I haven't been skating for a long while! I also found a good spot to hang out or have a group gathering.

Today I spent some time to prep for tomorrow’s peer presentation review session.
### Day 69: July 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
-  3.25 hours of coding practice

**Thoughts:**
1. **Do you know how it feels like that you know the questions are too hard to think, and you straight start to check the answer, but the answers are also so difficult, that you spend 1 hour on each question just to understand it and make sure that you can code yourself?** 
2. Besides that, my Ping Pong skill improved greatly. But, I prob need to pivot my energy to coding practices.
3. My friend paid for my noodle today. I was moved.
### Day 70: July 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
-  1 hr interview pre 

**Thoughts:**
1. Today was a lot of fun because we went belt sushi restaurant together, and I cut some watermelon for my friends. I took a video on the belt and people’s reactions were golden
2. I also took a lunch group photo
3. I played a bit ping pong and I am improving my skills

<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
