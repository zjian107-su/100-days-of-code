# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## I want to advance my Python programming and program documentation skills.
## More personal development content recorded on Intagram: danielzezheng.dev

### Day 1: January 05, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Search more resources to advance my skills in JavaScript and VueJs
- Tested template syntax on codepen

**Thoughts:** Working with Vue CLI was convinient, but it took me a while to run files with 'NPM and Vue'. Vue is easy to work with, at least for now.

### Day 2: January 08, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Vue directives
- 3 LeetCode practices

**Thoughts:** Feel like I need some review on JavaScript props



### Day 3: January 09, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 4 LeetCode practices: dynamic programming, DFS, BFS
- #100DaysOfCode forked repo setup
- Coding goal posted on personal Ins account

**Thoughts:** It is a great start of the project. I look forward to completing this project, and maybe making a good coding friend.

### Day 4: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 

- Luck will make things work. Taking risks to apply and face the fear of rejection because we can still appreciate what we learned during the process
- Searched phycology terms
- Did almost 2 hours of LeetCode practice
- OA coding for 2 hours

**Thoughts:** Dynamic programming is such a work of art! 

### Day 5: January 11, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Virtual interview with HW - 1 hour 
- OA from BR - 3 hours
  

**Thoughts:** Showing your ability to develop an efficient algorithm is much more important and difficult rather than dealing with user input ü•∏. I don't enjoy ACM mode much, I prefer core function mode. 

### Day 6: January 12, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 8 LeetCode Practices

**Thoughts** Being unhappy with what you don‚Äôt yet know is a sign that you‚Äôre a good developer.

### Day 7: January 13, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- Finished 3 LeetCode practices
- Earned 2 badges - Algo 01 and DS 01 in Python 
- Completed 1 OA from DB - 1 hour
  

**Thoughts:** DP, DFS, BFS, Matrix are difficult problems to solve. Whenever I find those in OA, I panic a little üòÜ, and sometimes I have to give up on them. Today marks my day 20 streak! Hooray!

### Day 8: January 14, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
  
**Thoughts:** headq.heapify(aList) =  O(n)

### Day 9: January 15, 2022


**Today's Progress**: 
- 2 hours OA from BD
  

**Thoughts:** 
Sum: the OA was fairly easy but handling user input in different formats need some practices. 

1. **Top-Down**: memoization is a great way for computationally expensive programs, **recursion**; **Botton-up**: an effective way of avoiding recursion by decreasing the time complexity that recursion builds up, recursion with memoization
2. Good quotes from @[cool_shark](https://leetcode.com/cool_shark) from [LeetCode.com](http://LeetCode.com)

> Training with LeetCode is like training for a marathon. For an onsite interview or programming competition, one needs to endure minimum 90 minutes to 6 hours of pain, that demand great deal of mental stamina and experience both of which require time to accumulate. With the exception of those naturally talented people who can run a full marathon without any preparation, normal people usually need to dedicate 6 months to 2 years of consistent training to be ready for a race. The preparation usually starts with a mild jogging, then gradually increase distance and speed so that one can run faster and longer. Beginners who never ran marathon have massive anxiety and are completely overwhelmed. But with planning and consistent training, anybody can run marathon including disabled people and 80 years old people.

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1 LeetCode practice
- 3 hours of Swift

**Thoughts:** 
It was a productive day. I worked and studied from 9:30 am to 0:30 am. It looked like 15 hours, but I spent 2 hours for my dinner. So it was 12 hours;) 

I am not very tired with my current workload becasue I am content ‚ò∫Ô∏è.

**Thoughts:** 
8 + 8 = 16 hr. üëç

### Day 27: Febuary 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- 1.5 hours of interview practice

**Thoughts:** 
My LeetCode skills get a little cold after resting for 10 days.

Big day!ü§™ I got another summer intern offer

### Day 28: Febuary 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift

**Thoughts:** 
struct vs class


### Day 29: March 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift for 2 hours

### Day 30: March 02, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Swift for 3 hours

**Thoughts:** 
MVVM, mutation, observer, struct and class
### Day 31: March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Elixir full review:  var, atom, condition, list, tuple, dict, aync (parallel), recursion, func, module. 

**Thoughts:** 
After drinking a few hours of elixir,  I am technically stronger. 
### Day 32: March 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
ctrl-B Move the cursor left
ctrl-F Move the cursor right d
ctrl-P View the previous command (or move the cursor up)
ctrl-N View the next command (or move the cursor down)
ctrl-A Move the cursor to the beginning of the line**

**ctrl-E Move the cursor to the end of the line
ctrl-W Erase the preceding word
ctrl-U Erase from cursor to beginning of line
ctrl-K Erase from cursor to end of line**

ctrl-Y Paste erased text (for example, from ctrl-U)

**Thoughts:** 
Linux is cool, but I found it hard to practice those commands in good use. For example, some of the materials, like symbolic links, I have learned those in my operating system class. I don‚Äôt find it practical in working place, yet. 
### Day 33: March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
More than 5 hours of Phoenix (Elixir)

- check version: `mix phoenix.new --version`
- pgadmin, postgresql
- phoenix new pages, controller, view, template, routers

**Thoughts:** 
I am stuck on the version problem because the current Phoenix(v1.6) set LiveView as the default and I am following a tutorial that used Phoenix(v1.5.5). I am working on the walkarounds, either learning the new version and implementing it in a new way by reading all the docs, or trying to roll back to 1.5.5 of Phoenix and the right version of Elixir. The tool configuration is daunting and I hope I can find better solutions.
### Day 34: March 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Codes


**Thoughts:** 
None

### Day 35: March 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Generated fake data with Python Faker and csv file for db use
- Operated Local PostgreSQL server with pgAdmin: create db, create dt, primary key, data type, constraint
- Ran Python grpc instance


**Thoughts:** 
Now I can say that I have some experience in PostgreSQL. Hooray!

### Day 36: March 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
#imageLiteral( can be used as image literal caller.


**Thoughts:** 
Coding monkey I am let‚Äôs go

### Day 37: April 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Alignment constraint and pining constraint in iOS
- AWS QuickSight data modeling


**Thoughts:** 
It was nice to catch up with friends about their jobs and work life balances. Great day!
### Day 38: April 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Linux reading


**Thoughts:** 
‚ú®¬†I learned some stuff about viking, therapy dog and Linux commands!

### Day 39: April 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
- Reading book ‚ÄúData And Reality‚Äù by William Kent


**Thoughts:** 
Someone lend this book and comment this book as ‚Äú50% of data and 50% of philosophy‚Äù. I like the way how the author starts this book by asking questions and throwing a bunch of examples to help people understand the questions. Learning by examples and clarifying with examples are the best way to go.

Due to human language ambiguity, whoever got the power to define would have the greatest power, such as lawmakers and great innovators.
Asking the accurate question is the most important for software engineers.
